# Listify
An app that helps you manage your foods at home, supports you while shopping and makes you cook better then ever before.

## Current Status
The app contains a working shopping list with the option to tick off items you bought and to add new ones randomly.
It also shows images corresponding to the name of the item inside the cells of the TableView.
The next step is to make a searchable VC with a searchable list of all the items you can add and give it another VC to add custom items to it.
